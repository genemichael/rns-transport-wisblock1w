# RatTunnel V. 1.0.33 — WisBlock 1W / Ikoka Stick / Heltec T096

> **Ikoka Stick (Seeed XIAO nRF52840 + EBYTE E22-900M30S) is an added
> target** — env `ikoka_stick_transport`. See
> [Ikoka Stick target](#ikoka-stick-target-xiao-nrf52840--e22-900m30s)
> below. The WisBlock 1W env is unchanged.

`RatTunnel` is a standalone Reticulum transport/repeater/node firmware for the RAKwireless WisBlock 1W stack (`RAK3401 + RAK13302`).
The name **RatTunnel** is a nod to [Ratspeak](https://github.com/ratspeak/), a messaging app/platform built on [Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/).

https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum

It is designed for safe field updates with:
- browser-based flashing (Chrome/Edge)
- local firmware hosting via `tools/serve_flasher.py`
- UF2 drag-and-drop fallback
- bootloader-safe update flow (non-bricking)

## Current Status

- Firmware brand/version: `RatTunnel V. 1.0.33`
- Hardware target: WisBlock 1W (`nRF52840 + SX1262`)
- Primary flashing path: Web flasher (`flasher/index.html`) served over HTTP
- Secondary flashing path: UF2 drag-and-drop bootloader drive
- OTA helper script: `tools/ota_update.py`

## What RatTunnel Currently Supports

- Reticulum-compatible announce handling, route learning, and path table persistence (up to 200 entries, 24 h expiry)
- Packet forwarding/relay for mesh/backbone transport with duplicate suppression
- Announce relay queue with jitter and hop-count-aware flooding (32-slot queue)
- Active peer discovery via periodic discovery sweeps; nearby nodes replay cached signed announces
- Configurable periodic announce and discovery cadence, adjustable at runtime and persisted to flash
- **Encrypted peer-to-peer messaging** using X25519 + Ed25519 (per-peer public keys extracted from announces)
- Broadcast announce-sideband messaging for peers without known keys
- Per-peer addressing by hash prefix or name (`msg @<hash>`, `msg @<name>`)
- Direct encrypted chat retries transient send failures, and the browser flasher waits for peer ACK before marking delivery complete
- Auto-reply to safe diagnostic prompts (`RT?PING7`, `RT?UP7`, `RT?MESH7`) — encrypted, rate-limited
- RSSI and SNR tracked per peer in the routing table
- USB serial command console with rich command set (see table below)
- Runtime radio parameter changes and persistence to flash (LittleFS)
- Per-channel LED behavior: idle mode (off / solid / heartbeat), RX/TX flash, Morse alert mode
- Morse code blink notifications for incoming messages and fault codes on-air
- LED incoming-message alert system with watch-list, repeat-count, and sticky modes
- **RatHole security mode**: optional identity wipe-on-boot for operational security
- Hardware watchdog (8 s timeout) — device auto-recovers from hangs
- Safe reboot into Adafruit nRF52 DFU bootloader (`dfu` command or button)

## Network Scope

This firmware target is for the RAK3401 + RAK13302 LoRa stack. It does not include an on-device Wi-Fi interface or TCP/IP stack for direct connection to a LAN or Reticulum TCP server.

To reach the Ratspeak Hub, use the host computer's network connection together with the built-in browser bridge:
- Run `python tools/serve_flasher.py --hub-bridge`
- Open the flasher UI and use the `Hub` tab
- The local WebSocket bridge forwards packets between the USB-connected radio and `rns.ratspeak.org:4242`

This gives the practical result most users want: the WisBlock radio participates in LoRa locally, and your network-connected computer bridges it into the wider Ratspeak/Reticulum hub.

## LED Behavior

The WisBlock 1W exposes two physical LEDs (green = P35, blue = P36). The firmware controls them independently per-channel:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green heartbeat (2 s) | Running normally |
| Blue pulse | Packet activity (RX or TX) |
| Green Morse digit loop | Fault code (e.g. `1` = radio init failed) |
| Alternating green/blue | Fatal error |

LED behavior is configurable at runtime with the `led` command and persisted to flash with `save`. Each channel supports:
- **Idle mode**: off, solid, or 2-second heartbeat blink
- **RX/TX flash**: brief pulse on packet activity
- **Morse alert mode**: blink Morse code for incoming messages (`incoming`), fault codes (`errors`), or both

### Incoming message alerts

The `led alert` system can:
- Blink a Morse alert immediately on every incoming message (`once`)
- Repeat the alert a configurable number of times at a configurable interval (`count`)
- Continue blinking until the conversation is opened (`until-clear`)
- Filter alerts to specific sender hash prefixes, optionally per LED channel (`led alert watch <hash16> [green+blue+red|auto]`)

## Peer Messaging

RatTunnel supports text messaging over the Reticulum radio link:

- `msg <text>` — broadcast to all peers; automatically uses encrypted path for peers with known public keys
- `msg @<hash> <text>` or `msg @<name> <text>` — address a specific peer; sends encrypted if key is available, falls back to broadcast sideband
- Encrypted messages use X25519 (key exchange) + Ed25519 (identity) keys extracted from announce packets
- Peer public keys are stored in the path table and survive path refreshes
- The browser flasher wraps direct encrypted chat with delivery ACKs and bounded retries; both peers must run current firmware for end-to-end delivery confirmation

### Auto-reply diagnostic prompts

Any peer can send the following exact strings to trigger a safe automated encrypted reply:

| Prompt | Reply | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RT?PING7` | `RT!PONG7 ok` | Connectivity check |
| `RT?UP7` | `RT!UP7 <fresh\|warm\|steady\|longrun>` | Uptime bucket |
| `RT?MESH7` | `RT!MESH7 <none\|few\|many>` | Path table size |

Replies are encrypted-only to authenticated peers, coarse-grained, and rate-limited per sender (15 s cooldown).

## RatHole Security Mode

RatHole provides a lightweight operational security feature for nodes that need to avoid persistent identity:

```bash
rathole on               # enable RatHole mode
rathole boot-reset on    # wipe identity and config on every reboot
save                     # persist the setting
```

When `boot-reset` is on, each power cycle generates a fresh identity key pair — the node appears as a different Reticulum destination on every boot. The RatHole flag itself is preserved across wipes so the setting survives reboot.


## Heltec Mesh Node T096 target (nRF52840 + SX1262 + KCT8103L)

Hardware: [Heltec Mesh Node T096](https://heltec.org/project/t096/) —
nRF52840, SX1262 with a KCT8103L front-end (PA + LNA, ~28 dBm), UC6580
GNSS and a 0.96" TFT. RatTunnel uses the radio, the LED and the button;
the TFT rail (Vext) and the GNSS rail are held off. Build with:

```
pio run -e heltec_t096_transport
```

Outputs land in `.pio/build/heltec_t096_transport/` (`firmware.uf2` for
drag-and-drop onto the `HT-n5262G` bootloader drive). Double-tap reset
to get the drive, or use the console `dfu` command, or **hold the user
button while resetting**.

### SoftDevice / linker

The T096 ships Heltec's Adafruit-derived bootloader with S140 **v6.1.1**,
so this target links at 0x26000 like the WisBlock 1W and uses the BSP's
stock linker script (`boards/heltec_t096_s140v6.json`, provenance in
`boards/README.md`). **Check `INFO_UF2.TXT` on the bootloader drive
before the first flash** and confirm 6.1.1; the portal refuses the
0x27000 (Ikoka) image on an `HT-n5262G` drive, but a manual drag of the
wrong image is not protected.

### TX power is a firmware invariant on this board

| Constant | KCT8103L | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `LORA_TX_DBM_VARIANT_MAX` | 22 dBm | Meshtastic `heltec_mesh_node_t096` and MeshCore `heltec_t096` both allow the full SX1262 range ("Max SX1262 output -> ~28dBm at antenna") |
| `LORA_TX_DBM_MAX_SAFE` (build cap) | 18 dBm | on the gain knee; nothing above it but current |
| `LORA_TX_DBM` (default) | 18 dBm | |
| `LORA_TX_DBM_ANNOUNCE_SAFE` | 18 dBm | |

Derivation, verified 2026-09-25 against primary sources:

| Fact | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Pad between SX1262 and FEM TX input | 280 Ω series, 59 Ω / 59 Ω shunt = **21.1 dB** | Heltec schematic `Mesh_Node_T096_V0.2`, sheet 1 (R37/R38/R39) |
| KCT8103L TX gain / Psat at 3.3 V | 33.0 dB / **28.0 dBm** | Kangxi Communication product portfolio, KCT8103L row |
| Vfem supply | 3.3 V LDO (U5 TLV75733) | schematic |
| Family absolute-max TX input | **+8 dBm** | KCT8101L datasheet rev C (sibling part; no KCT8103L datasheet obtainable) |

So the FEM saturates at 16 dBm chip drive (−5 dBm at its input), the
full 22 dBm chip drive delivers only +0.9 dBm to the FEM, 7 dB under
the family absolute maximum, and the 18 dBm cap sits 2 dB past the
saturation knee at −3.1 dBm FEM input. The Heltec V4 bench table in
MeshCore issue #1708 (same FEM family) shows the same knee: 27–28 dBm
conducted from setting 18 upward. Prns's measured T096 gain table
agrees (net 14 dB at low drive tapering to 7 dB at 21 dBm).

**Verify with a power meter before sustained TX** — see
[docs/BENCH_HELTEC_T096.md](docs/BENCH_HELTEC_T096.md).

### FEM control

The KCT8103L has three control lines plus the SX1262's DIO2:

| Net | GPIO | Firmware | Board default |
|---|---|---|---|
| VFEM_Ctrl (FEM LDO enable) | P0.30 | HIGH at radio init | 5.1 MΩ pull-up (on) |
| PA_CSD (chip enable) | P0.12 | HIGH at radio init | 10 kΩ pulldown (**PA off**) |
| PA_CTX (RX path) | P1.09 | LOW = 21 dB LNA | 10 kΩ pulldown (LNA) |
| PA_CPS (TX/RX select) | SX1262 DIO2 | `setDio2AsRfSwitch(true)` | 10 kΩ pulldown |

Because CSD has a pulldown, the PA stays off until `RNSRadio::begin()`
asserts it; a firmware that never gets that far leaves the FEM idle.

### Status display

The 0.96" ST7735 TFT (160x80 landscape) shows a three-page dashboard,
driven by `include/RNSDisplay.h` on the Adafruit GFX + ST7735 stack
(the same driver family RNode firmware uses on Heltec TFTs). The panel
sits on the Vext rail, which is only powered while the panel is awake.

| Page | Content |
|---|---|
| 1 STATUS | name, battery % (or `USB`), uptime, free RAM, RX/TX/forwarded, announces/duplicates/invalid, RX/TX bytes, paths, last RSSI/SNR, radio one-liner |
| 2 RADIO | frequency, bandwidth, SF, CR, preamble, TX drive and cap, sync word, RX mode, init result |
| 3 PEERS | first seven path-table entries: hash, name, hops, RSSI, age |

* **Button** (P1.10): a short press wakes a blanked panel, or advances
  the page. The boot-time hold-for-DFU behaviour is unchanged.
* **Timeout**: `display timeout <seconds>` (0 = never, max 3600, default
  60) blanks the panel and drops the Vext rail; persisted in
  `/display.bin`. `display on|off` parks the panel entirely;
  `display page [n]` selects a page; `display` alone prints the state.
* **Battery**: the on-board 390K/100K divider on P0.03 is gated by
  P1.15 and read every 10 s. On USB power the top row shows `USB`.
* Rows are cached and only redrawn when their text changes, so the 1 Hz
  refresh normally repaints one or two rows.

### Pin map

From the Heltec V0.2 schematic net table, raw nRF52840 numbering:

| Function | GPIO | # |
|---|---|---|
| SX1262 NSS / SCK / MOSI / MISO | P0.05 / P1.08 / P0.11 / P0.14 | 5 / 40 / 11 / 14 |
| SX1262 RESET / BUSY / DIO1 | P0.16 / P0.19 / P0.21 | 16 / 19 / 21 |
| Vext_Ctrl (TFT rail, held LOW) | P0.26 | 26 |
| VGNSS_CTRL (PMOS, held HIGH = off) | P0.06 | 6 |
| White LED (active HIGH) | P0.28 | 28 |
| User button (active LOW, 10 kΩ pull-up) | P1.10 | 42 |

The SX1262 supply (VDD_IN / VBAT) is on the always-on VDD_3V3 LDO, not
on Vext, so the radio runs with the display rail off.

## Air framing: RNode split packets

Every LoRa frame carries RNode's one-byte header (`seq << 4 | flags`).
A Reticulum packet longer than 254 bytes is sent as two frames sharing
the sequence nibble with the split flag (bit 0) set, 254 payload bytes
in the first, the rest in the second, exactly as RNode_Firmware
`transmit()` does; the receiver reassembles by sequence the way RNode's
`receive_callback()` does. Before 2026-09-25 RatTunnel sent one frame
per packet and never reassembled, so anything over 254 bytes on air
(the map discovery announce, LXMF announces with a ratchet and a long
name) was refused on TX with RadioLib rc -4 and counted as Invalid on RX.

## Map discovery announce (RMAP, `discoverable = yes`)

All targets can announce themselves the way a Python RNS node does for a
discoverable interface, so the node shows up on RMAP-style maps with its
position and radio parameters. Off by default.

```
location 47.043620 -122.872110 [height_m]   # or: location clear
discovery on                                # computes the proof-of-work stamp once
discovery                                   # state, stamp progress, next announce
discovery interval <5-1440>                 # minutes, default 360 (6 h, the RNS default)
discovery now                               # send one immediately
discovery dump                              # PACKED / INFOHASH / APPDATA / DEST for validation
```

What goes on the air (`include/RNSDiscovery.h`): a normal announce for
the destination `rnstransport.discovery.interface` from this node's
identity, with app data `[flags 0x00][msgpack map][32-byte stamp]`. The
map has the same keys and value types as `RNS/Discovery.py`
(`RNodeInterface`, transport flag, identity hash, name, float64
latitude/longitude/height or nil, frequency/bandwidth in Hz, SF, CR).
The stamp is LXStamper hashcash: a 20-round HKDF workblock over the
descriptor hash and a 32-byte nonce whose SHA-256 has 16 leading zero
bits. The search keeps a SHA-256 midstate so each attempt is one
compression; it runs in 48-attempt slices from the main loop (~65k
attempts on average, a few seconds) and the result is cached in
`/discovery.bin`, so it only recomputes when the name, position or
radio parameters change.

Validate a node's bytes against the reference implementation (needs the
`rns` Python package):

```
python tools/validate_discovery.py < dump.txt     # paste `discovery dump` output
```

Bench 2026-09-25, T096: stamp found on-device, reference validator
reports `VALID`, all handler field checks pass.

## Ikoka Stick target (XIAO nRF52840 + E22-900M30S)

Hardware: [ndoo/ikoka-stick-meshtastic-device](https://github.com/ndoo/ikoka-stick-meshtastic-device),
populated with a Seeed XIAO nRF52840 and an EBYTE E22-900M30S (SX1262 +
PA + LNA, 30 dBm). Build with:

```
pio run -e ikoka_stick_transport
```

Outputs land in `.pio/build/ikoka_stick_transport/` (`firmware.uf2` for
drag-and-drop onto the `XIAO-BOOT` bootloader drive, `firmware.zip` for
`adafruit-nrfutil`). Double-tap reset to get the drive, or use the
console `dfu` command, or **hold the D0 user button while resetting**.

### Do not flash the WisBlock image onto a XIAO

The portal's Flash tab lists every release asset. The WisBlock 1W UF2
loads at 0x26000, which on the XIAO is the **last page of the S140
v7.3.0 SoftDevice**; writing it leaves the board hung in setup (solid
green LED, USB enumerated but the console never answers). The portal now
refuses that write when the bootloader drive is named `XIAO-BOOT`, but a
manual drag-and-drop is not protected. Always pick the
`rns-transport-ikoka-stick-*.uf2` asset for this board. Recovery without
serial DFU: `tools/make_sd_repair_uf2.py`, procedure in
`docs/BENCH_IKOKA_STICK.md` §0b.

### Board revision — read this first

The E22 is fed by an MT3608 boost converter hanging off the XIAO's
charger output. **Ikoka Stick boards before v0.2.0 drew excessive current
when no battery was inserted**; fixed by commit
[2cd2400](https://github.com/ndoo/ikoka-stick-meshtastic-device/commit/2cd2400)
("Supply E22 LoRa module +5V2 rail from 5V when no battery is present",
tag `v0.2.0-52a6ed2`). Commit 84d24a0 also raised the LoRa supply
current budget from 1 A to 2.5 A. Use v0.2.0 or later, and keep
RatTunnel's power mitigations (17→18 dBm conservative default, SX1262
current limit 140 mA, DCDC regulator, announce-time TX cap, watchdog +
reset-cause logging) — they are all active on this target.

### TX power is a firmware invariant on this board

The E22-900M30S PA will be damaged by too much SX1262 drive. RatTunnel's
WisBlock power table (17 dBm into a SKY66122) is **not** valid here, so
this target carries its own table in `include/RNSConfig.h`:

| Constant | E22-900M30S | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `LORA_TX_DBM_VARIANT_MAX` | 20 dBm | MeshCore `variants/ikoka_stick_nrf/platformio.ini` @ 0679dbe: "limit txpower to 20dBm on E22-900M30S … 20dBm in -> 30dBm out" |
| `LORA_TX_DBM_MAX_SAFE` (build cap) | 18 dBm | 2 dB under the ceiling, pending power-meter check |
| `LORA_TX_DBM` (default) | 18 dBm | |
| `LORA_TX_DBM_ANNOUNCE_SAFE` | 18 dBm | same PA basis; rail rated 2.5 A |

Ebyte's own E22-900M30S manual (v1.20 §2.2 p.3 / v1.5 rev 1.4 §2.2 p.5)
gives only "Max Tx power 29.5/30/31 dBm, TX current 650 mA" and **no PA
gain or drive-level table**, so the ceiling is MeshCore's field-proven
figure, not a datasheet number. The 9 dBm limit you may have seen quoted
for Ikoka boards is MeshCore's rule for the **E22-900M33S**, a different
module ("9dBm in -> 33dBm out").

The cap is enforced in `RNSRadio::clampTxDbm()`, which is the only path
to `lora.setOutputPower()` and `lora.begin()`. The console `set txpower`,
`profile` presets, a persisted `config.bin` from another build, and the
`scan`/`sfscan` re-inits all pass through it. A `static_assert` refuses
to build a cap above the variant maximum.

**Verify with a power meter before sustained TX** — see
[docs/BENCH_IKOKA_STICK.md](docs/BENCH_IKOKA_STICK.md).

### Pin map

From the Ikoka README GPIO table, raw nRF52840 numbering (pca10056):

| Function | XIAO | GPIO | # |
|---|---|---|---|
| User button (active LOW, board pull-up) | D0 | P0.02 | 2 |
| E22 DIO1 (IRQ) | D1 | P0.03 | 3 |
| E22 RST | D2 | P0.28 | 28 |
| E22 BUSY | D3 | P0.29 | 29 |
| E22 NSS | D4 | P0.04 | 4 |
| E22 RXEN | D5 | P0.05 | 5 |
| E22 SCK / MISO / MOSI | D8 / D9 / D10 | P1.13 / P1.14 / P1.15 | 45 / 46 / 47 |
| E22 TXEN | — | wired to SX1262 **DIO2** on the PCB | `setDio2AsRfSwitch(true)` |
| LEDs (active LOW) | — | green P0.30, blue P0.06, red P0.26 | 30 / 6 / 26 |

The optional SSD1306 OLED on D6/D7 is not used.

### SoftDevice / linker

The XIAO ships with S140 **v7.3.0**, so this env uses
`boards/xiao_nrf52840_s140v7.json` (fwid 0x0123), links with
`boards/nrf52840_s140_v7.ld` (app at 0x27000) and compiles against the
v7 API headers in `lib/nrf52/`. Provenance in `boards/README.md`.
`tools/generate_uf2.py` needs no change: the UF2 family ID is the same
nRF52840 ID and the base address is read from the hex.

### Memory

| | WisBlock 1W | Ikoka Stick |
|---|---|---|
| `.data` + `.bss` (arm-none-eabi-size) | 1,064 + 234,456 = 235,520 B | 1,160 + 234,360 = 235,520 B |
| PlatformIO "RAM used" (`.data`+`.bss` minus the BSP's own reservation) | 111,720 B of 248,832 | 111,824 B of 237,568 |
| Flash (`.text`+`.data`) | 313,256 B (app @ 0x26000) | 308,344 B (app @ 0x27000) |

The Ikoka figure has 11,264 B less RAM available because the S140 v7
linker script reserves RAM up to 0x20006000 for the SoftDevice. Live
free heap: `status` on the console prints `Free RAM:` (stack pointer
minus heap end); record it in the bench sheet.

### Path persistence

Neither target persists the path table; `/paths.bin` is reserved but
never written (`PATH_TABLE_MAX` 200 entries live in RAM only). Internal
LittleFS is 28 KB (7 × 4 KB pages at 0xED000) shared by identity, config,
LED, morse, security, auth and name blobs — a full 200-entry table
(~27 KB) would not fit there anyway. The XIAO's on-board 2 MB P25Q16H
QSPI flash is the natural home if persistence is added; costing is in
`docs/DeveloperGuide.md`.

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Part Number |
|---|---|
| WisMesh 1W Booster Starter Kit | RAK10724 |
| or Core | RAK3401 |
| and IO module | RAK13302 |
| and Base board | RAK19007 |
| Power | USB-C (recommended 5V/1.5A+) or LiPo |

> Important: the 1W radio path can draw high peak current. Use a stable power source.

## Build Firmware Locally

```bash
pip install platformio
pio run -e wisblock_1w_transport
```

Build outputs are generated under `.pio/build/wisblock_1w_transport/`, including:
- `firmware.hex`
- `firmware.uf2` (generated by `tools/generate_uf2.py` post-build)

## Use `serve_flasher.py` (Recommended)

`tools/serve_flasher.py` launches a local HTTP server rooted at the workspace so modern browser APIs are available.

### Why this script exists

Opening `flasher/index.html` directly with `file://` is unreliable for Web Serial + File System Access workflows. Serving over HTTP is the most consistent setup.

### Start server

```bash
python tools/serve_flasher.py
```

Default behavior:
- binds to `127.0.0.1:8000`
- serves workspace root
- opens browser automatically to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/flasher/`

### Common options

```bash
python tools/serve_flasher.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
python tools/serve_flasher.py --no-open
python tools/serve_flasher.py --hub-bridge
python tools/serve_flasher.py --hub-bridge --hub-ws-port 8765 --hub-tcp-host rns.ratspeak.org --hub-tcp-port 4242
```

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind interface (`0.0.0.0` = LAN-visible) |
| `--port` | `8000` | HTTP server port |
| `--no-open` | off | Do not auto-launch browser |
| `--hub-bridge` | off | Also start local WebSocket→TCP bridge for Ratspeak Hub |
| `--hub-ws-host` | `127.0.0.1` | WebSocket bind host for bridge |
| `--hub-ws-port` | `8765` | WebSocket bind port for bridge |
| `--hub-tcp-host` | `rns.ratspeak.org` | Upstream hub hostname |
| `--hub-tcp-port` | `4242` | Upstream hub TCP port |

## Web Flasher Workflow

1. Start server with `python tools/serve_flasher.py`
2. Open Chrome or Edge desktop
3. Choose a release version (or local file)
4. Optional: click `Connect device` for auto DFU trigger
5. Click `Flash firmware`
6. If prompted, click `Write to device drive` and choose `RAK4631` bootloader drive
7. Wait for success and automatic reboot

### Repeater settings menu (connectivity)

After serial connect and repeater detection, switch to **Repeater mode** to use the settings menu:
- Choose a connectivity profile (`RNode EU` / `RNode US` / `Ratspeak US balanced`) or keep `Custom`
- Edit frequency/SF/BW/CR/TX/sync word and optional broadcast name
- Use `Apply + Save` to write settings and persist in one step
- Use `Announce now` to immediately test visibility from peers
- Use `Verify Link` to run `radio`, `status`, and `announce` in one click with pass/fail hints
- Repeater mode now shows a **Detected nodes** area populated from live routing table entries

### Browser/API requirements

- Supported: Chrome / Edge (desktop, Web Serial enabled)
- Not supported: Safari, Firefox for this flow

## How the Flasher Selects Firmware

The web UI:
1. queries GitHub Releases API for this repo
2. filters releases that include upload-complete assets ending in `.uf2`, `.bin`, or `.hex`
3. falls back to `flasher/firmware/latest.uf2` from `main` if no formal release is found
4. allows local file upload as final fallback

## Publishing a Public Build (Release Path)

To make the new build available publicly from the version picker:

1. Build firmware (`pio run -e wisblock_1w_transport`)
2. Copy/update `flasher/firmware/latest.uf2`
3. Commit + push to GitHub
4. Create a GitHub Release and attach firmware assets (`.uf2` preferred)

Once a release exists with valid assets, the web flasher will list it automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Flasher page loads but connect fails
- Ensure Chrome or Edge desktop is used
- Close other serial terminal apps that may own the port
- Replug USB cable and retry `Connect device`

### `Read error: The device has been lost`
- This usually means the USB serial link briefly dropped (cable movement, power dip, or device reset)
- The flasher now attempts to auto-reconnect to previously authorized serial ports
- If disconnects repeat, use a shorter/high-quality USB cable and a stable 5V supply (1.5A+ recommended)
- Avoid running multiple serial tools at the same time (browser + terminal app)

### Node does not appear on a known-good Reticulum LoRa device
- Ensure on-air parameters match exactly on both sides: frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, and sync word
- In console, run `radio` to inspect current settings
- Fast path: apply one-shot preset with `profile rnode-eu`, `profile rnode-us`, or `profile ratspeak-us`
- Set values as needed, for example: `set freq 915`, `set sf 9`, `set bw 125`, `set cr 5`, `set txpower 17`, `set syncword 0x12`, `set preamble 18`
- If `announce` causes reconnect/reboot, lower TX power first (17 dBm or less) and ensure stable USB power/cable
- `announce` now transmits with a temporary safe TX cap to reduce brownout-triggered resets, then restores configured TX power
- Run `save` to persist settings, then `announce` to broadcast immediately

### Flash button disabled
- Select a release version or enable local file mode
- Wait for release metadata fetch to complete
- Check network access to GitHub API/releases

### Device does not enter DFU automatically
- Use `Enter DFU mode` button
- If needed, double-tap hardware reset button
- Confirm bootloader USB drive appears (`RAK4631` or similar)

### `Write to device drive` cannot find drive
- Re-enter DFU mode and wait a few seconds
- Reconnect USB cable
- Manually download UF2 and drag/drop to bootloader drive

### Firmware update interrupted
- Re-enter DFU mode and repeat flash
- Bootloader remains intact; previous app typically remains recoverable

### No releases shown in picker
- Verify release assets are uploaded and not drafts
- Confirm filenames end with `.uf2`, `.bin`, or `.hex`
- Use local file fallback immediately if needed

## Safety Model

- Bootloader is not overwritten by this project
- Watchdog protects against stalled main loop
- Radio init failure still leaves serial console available
- DFU mode is reachable from command (`dfu`) or double-reset
